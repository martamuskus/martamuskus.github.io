    <summary>history</summary>
    <p class="bg-gray-100"> Delphi is a software development environment and programming language originally created by Borland in 1995. It evolved from Turbo Pascal and was designed as a rapid application development (RAD) tool for Windows, featuring an Object Pascal-based language and a powerful visual component library (VCL). Delphi gained popularity for its ease of use, fast compilation, and ability to build native Windows applications.

        In the early 2000s, Borland shifted focus, leading to the transfer of Delphi to CodeGear in 2006 and later to Embarcadero Technologies in 2008. Under Embarcadero, Delphi expanded beyond Windows to support macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux, integrating FireMonkey (FMX) for cross-platform development.

        Despite competition from other languages and frameworks, Delphi remains relevant due to its strong legacy applications, active community, and continuous updates. Modern Delphi versions offer Unicode support, 64-bit compilation, and cloud integration, keeping it viable for enterprise and embedded systems development.

        <h1>Basic overview</h1>
        <h2>Interoperability</h2>
        <p>
            Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, are interoperable. They share many core components, notably the IDE, the VCL and FMX frameworks, and much of the runtime library. In addition, they can be used jointly in a project. For example, C++Builder 6 and later can combine source code from Delphi and C++ in one project, while packages compiled with C++Builder can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as RAD Studio, a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, which can be purchased with either or both. Starting with Rio, there is also interoperability with Python.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            Delphi supports rapid application development (RAD). Prominent features are a visual designer and two application frameworks, Visual Component Library (VCL) for Windows and FireMonkey (FMX) for cross-platform development.

            Delphi uses the Pascal-based programming language Object Pascal created by Anders Hejlsberg for Borland (now IDERA) as the successor to Turbo Pascal. It supports native cross-compilation to many platforms including Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.

            To better support development for Microsoft Windows and interoperate with code developed with other software development tools, Delphi supports independent interfaces of Component Object Model (COM) with reference counting class implementations, and support for many third-party components. Interface implementations can be delegated to fields or properties of classes. Message handlers are implemented by tagging a method of a class with the integer constant of the message to handle.

            Database connectivity is extensively supported through VCL database-aware and database access components.

            Later versions have included upgraded and enhanced runtime library routines, some provided by the community group FastCode.
